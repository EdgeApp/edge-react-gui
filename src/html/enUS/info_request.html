      This screen allows you to request bitcoin from another user. Choose the destination wallet by clicking the wallet name in the top header.
      <br>
      <br>
      Present QR code to Sender and have them scan the code to send you bitcoin. Once bitcoin is received, this screen will automatically detect the transaction and proceed to the Transaction Details where you can tag your transaction.
      <br />
      <br />
      Tap the [Email] or [SMS] buttons to send a request to a remote user via email or SMS.
      <br />
      <br />
      You can also copy the address of this request using the [Copy] button and paste it into a different wallet application to send funds.
      <br />
      <br />
      You may optionally enter an amount to request by tapping in the [Enter Amount] text field or by tapping the QR code. Tap the top right toggle button to choose between bitcoin or fiat (USD, EUR). If no amount is entered, the Sender will determine the amount of bitcoin to send.
