/**
 * Wrapper for workflow functions that handles graceful early exits via Exit
 * thrown Exit errors.
 *
 * The purpose of this is to leverage throws as a hidden control flow for
 * simpler workflow code. It is simply a try-catch wrapper to handle only Exit
 * errors gracefully and nothing else. If a workflow needs to handle other
 * errors, then use a try-catch block.
 *
 * Why not just use a try-catch block instead of this utility for Exit errors?
 * The reason is to not temp developers to use the try-catch block for handling
 * other errors when error handling typically should be handled at the top-level
 * and rarely should we be handling errors in a try-catch block within some
 * routine.
 *
 * @param fn - The workflow function to execute
 * @returns Promise that resolves when workflow completes or exits gracefully
