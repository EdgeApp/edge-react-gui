/**
 * Tracks the currect keyboard state,
 * and updates an animated value as the keyboard moves up or down.
 *
 * The animation moves smoothly between a "down value" and an "up value".
 * You provide these endpoints as props, so they can accomodate things
 * like notches or weird layouts. If your layout changes (like when the
 * device rotates), just pass new values for `upValue` or `downValue`,
 * and the animated value will adjust to match. If `upValue` depends on
 * the keyboard height, just pass a function instead of number.
 *
 * This component also provides a "layout value" to your component.
 * The layout value changes to the final `upValue` right before
 * the keyboard starts sliding up, and goes back to `downValue`
 * after the keyboard finishes disappearing. This gives you a chance
 * to make layout updates in preparation for the animation, like adding
 * extra space to the bottom of your component so a gap doesn't appear.
